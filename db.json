      "lyrics": "She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene / I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one / Who will dance on the floor in the round? / She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round / She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene / Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one / Who will dance on the floor in the round / People always told me be careful of what you do / And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts / And mother always told me be careful of who you love / And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth / Billie Jean is not my lover / She's just a girl who claims that I am the one / But the kid is not my son / She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son / For forty days and forty nights / The law was on her side / But who can stand when she's in demand / Her schemes and plans / 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round / So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice / (Do think twice, do think twice) / She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me / Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no) / 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby / People always told me be careful of what you do / And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts / She came and stood right by me / Just the smell of sweet perfume / This happened much too soon / She called me to her room / Billie Jean is not my lover / She's just a girl who claims that I am the one / But the kid is not my son / Billie Jean is not my lover / She's just a girl who claims that I am the one / But the kid is not my son / She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son / She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son / Billie Jean is not my lover / She's just a girl who claims that I am the one / But the kid is not my son / She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son / She says I am the one / You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe / She says I am the one / Billie Jean is not my lover / Billie Jean is not my lover / Billie Jean is not my lover / Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean) / Billie Jean is not my lover / Billie Jean is not my lover"
